						<p>&OpenCurlyQuote;My artwork tells the story of the Holmesglen Institute and its seven Campuses as they sit on some of the surrounding lands of the Kulin Nation Woiwurrung
							&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;Wurundjeri&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;, Bunurong, Wathaurong, Taungurung and Dja Dja Wurrung people.</p>
						<p>This painting also represents togetherness as we work
							together as one, culture as we share and respect and
							acknowledge First Nations people, our students as we
							teach them to be the best they can be, our staff, and the
							journey and future of Holmesglen as we work together.&CloseCurlyQuote;</p>

						<p>Luke never sketches ideas or plans out artwork. Instead,
							he lets his hand do the talking. This piece started as
							a demonstration of his art during &OpenCurlyQuote;O&CloseCurlyQuote; week and NAIDOC
							week 2023. Once the piece was back home, Luke found
							employment with Holmesglen in the Koori Support Unit
							and decided he wanted to tell the story of Holmesglen
							through the artwork.</p>
							<p>As the painting developed, Luke found himself enjoying
								the process more and more. Once it was finished, he
								had grown quite attached and it almost ended up on his
								wall at home. But in a RAP committee meeting in early
								2024, it was suggested we include the piece as the
								cover art for the Holmesglen RAP and fortunately for us,
								Luke liked the idea!</p>
